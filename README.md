# Segmentation-and-Object-Shape-Analysis
CS 585 Assignment Three Segmentation and Object Shape Analysis

## To Do:
* ~~Implement two segmentation functions~~
* ~~Implement connected components function (stack based)~~
* ~~Implement component reduction function~~
* ~~Implement area function~~
* ~~Implement orientation function~~
* ~~Implement circularity function~~
* ~~Implement parameter function~~
* ~~Implement compactness function~~
* ~~Implement ratio of perimeter to area function~~
* ~~Implement bat segmentation process (amost done)~~
* ~~Implement cell segmentation process~~
* ~~Implement aquarium segmentation process~~

## Notes:
* Bat and Cell data sets work very well
* Aquarium data set works okay, there were some last minute problems with how circularity was calculated which we had to work around
